//Nora's Class... 

/*
	Pop up window for creating new events
		-Called from main class 'Schedule'
		-Collects information to store in 'ScheduleEvent'
		-Returns newly 'ScheduledEvent' to 'Schedule'
		
	BASIC_STRUCTURE
	
	
	Notes:
		Will need to extend class JFrame JFrame
		
		Time variable should be selected from JComboBox (like a drop down menu). This will make it easier to assign the proper jlabel for time slots
			-Will also limit to classes that don't align perfectly - Difficult for lab times
	TO_DO
		Declare variables (courseName, day(s), time, location, bgColor, anything else? ) to collect
		
		create JTextFields, OptionPanes, or other form to collect data in proper format
		- JColorChooser to select background
		
		
		
		- Check boxes to select days
			values(Monday 0, Tuesday 1, ...)
		
		create a new 'ScheduleEvent' with variables
		return new 'ScheduleEvent' to main class
